I appreciated for the second chance.
I did not submit the assignment of the html before but i uploaded it in github due the deadline,at first i was having problem with uploading a huge video file and then i ignored the video and it rejected me too.

But i was wondering what ‘1mark each minute delay means’. Is the penalty for the previous upload or it applies to a new one.(it’s whether i should upload it again or send the video ignored file).

###and with this confusion this is the right format and with my video included but being zipped.###

Thanking you in advance, 
Section 4 student.
